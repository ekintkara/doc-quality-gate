description: "Review an implementation document against the project codebase using Doc Quality Gate"
---

You are running a Doc Quality Gate (DQG) review.

CRITICAL RULES — READ THESE BEFORE PROCEEDING:
1. Do NOT run `start.ps1`, `start.bat`, `start.sh`, or any setup script. They will block the terminal.
2. Do NOT start LiteLLM proxy or web server manually.
3. Do NOT write your own Python commands or HTTP calls.
4. The ONLY commands you need are the `python DQG_SCRIPT ...` commands below.

The user invoked `/dqg $ARGUMENTS`.

**Step 0 — Detect mode: `from-jira` vs `review`**

Parse the arguments to detect the mode:

- If arguments start with `from-jira`, this is a **Jira task mode**. Example: `/dqg from-jira PROJ-123 --cp C:\projects\my-context`
  - `$1` = `from-jira`, `$2` = task key (e.g. `PROJ-123`), remaining = flags
  - Supported flags: `--cp PATH`, `--project PATH`, `--generate-only`
  - Skip to **Step 1-Jira** below.

- Otherwise, this is a **document review mode**. Example: `/dqg path/to/plan.md --cp C:\projects\my-context`
  - The first non-flag argument is the document path.
  - Continue to **Step 1-Review** below.

## JIRA TASK MODE

**Step 1-Jira — Find DQG script and launch from-jira review**

Find the DQG script path:

!`python -c "from pathlib import Path; p=Path.home()/'.config'/'opencode'/'dqg_home'; print(Path(p.read_text('utf-8-sig').strip())/'scripts'/'dqg_run.py')"`

Launch the from-jira review asynchronously. This starts services if needed, reads the Jira task, generates an implementation document, and kicks off the full DQG pipeline. It returns immediately with a REVIEW_ID:

!`python DQG_SCRIPT launch-from-jira TASK_KEY`{{append `--cp CONTEXT_PATH` if --cp was provided}}{{append `--project PROJECT_PATH` if --project was provided}}{{append `--generate-only` if --generate-only was specified}}

Set timeout to 60000ms (1 minute) for this command — it should return quickly after launching.

Save the REVIEW_ID from the output.

**Step 2-Jira — Poll for results (repeat until complete)**

Poll for results using the REVIEW_ID from Step 1. Each poll checks a few times (~1 minute). If the review is still running, run the command again. Repeat until you get REVIEW_COMPLETE or REVIEW_FAILED:

!`python DQG_SCRIPT poll REVIEW_ID --max-attempts 6`

If output says `POLL_INCOMPLETE`, just run the same command again. The full from-jira pipeline takes 5-15 minutes total.

Set timeout to 120000ms (2 minutes) for each poll command.

**Step 3-Jira — Present results**

When the poll returns REVIEW_COMPLETE or REVIEW_FAILED, parse the output and present the results:

- If `--generate-only` was used: Show the user the path to the generated document and suggest running `/dqg` on it for review.
- If full pipeline ran: Parse the output and present the results (score, issues, etc.) — use the PRESENT RESULTS section below.

## DOCUMENT REVIEW MODE

**Step 1-Review — Resolve the document path**

Parse the arguments:
- The first non-flag argument is the document path (e.g. `docs/plan.md` or `./plan.md`).
- If no document path is provided, look for the most recently modified markdown file in the project that looks like an implementation document. Check these locations in order:
  1. `docs/*.md`
  2. `*.md` (project root, excluding README)
  3. `plans/*.md`
  4. `design/*.md`
  Pick the most recently modified one and confirm with the user before proceeding.
- `--cp PATH` — (optional) Path to a structured domain context directory (e.g. `C:\projects\my-context`). This contains architecture, conventions, domain docs etc.

Save the absolute document path as DOC_PATH, the current working directory (project root) as PROJECT_PATH, and any context path as CONTEXT_PATH.

**Important:** If `--cp` is provided but `--project` is not, PROJECT_PATH defaults to the current working directory automatically. This ensures cross-reference analysis runs against the codebase you're working in.

**Step 2-Review — Find DQG script and launch the review**

First, find the DQG script path:

!`python -c "from pathlib import Path; p=Path.home()/'.config'/'opencode'/'dqg_home'; print(Path(p.read_text('utf-8-sig').strip())/'scripts'/'dqg_run.py')"`

Then launch the review. This starts services if needed and kicks off the review asynchronously. It returns immediately with a REVIEW_ID:

!`python DQG_SCRIPT launch DOC_PATH --project PROJECT_PATH`{{if CONTEXT_PATH was provided, append: `--cp CONTEXT_PATH`}}

If the user specified a document type, add `--type TYPE`.

Save the REVIEW_ID from the output.

**Step 3-Review — Poll for results (repeat until complete)**

Poll for results using the REVIEW_ID from Step 2. Each poll checks a few times (~1 minute). If the review is still running, run the command again. Repeat until you get REVIEW_COMPLETE or REVIEW_FAILED:

!`python DQG_SCRIPT poll REVIEW_ID --max-attempts 6`

If output says `POLL_INCOMPLETE`, just run the same command again. The review pipeline takes 5-15 minutes total.

Set timeout to 120000ms (2 minutes) for each poll command.

## PRESENT RESULTS

Parse the output and present clearly:

## Doc Quality Gate Results

**Score:** X.XX/10 — **PASS/FAIL**
**Action:** implement / revise_again / human_review

### Cross-Reference Issues (Codebase vs Document)
[List the issues]

### Document Quality Issues
[Summarize the main quality issues]

### Dimension Scores
[Brief summary of weakest dimensions]

**Next step — Ask the user what to do next**

1. **Fix issues** — Revise the implementation document based on the review findings
2. **Revise code** — Update the actual codebase to align with the document
3. **Just show** — No action needed
